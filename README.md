# WSUV ENCS Message Board   
Start at March 30, 2014  

For this project we will create a client iOS application for a Twitter-like service.   
User information and messages are stored on a server and are accessible via a web-based API using HTTP GET/POST methods.   We will use the delightful Alamofire framework to communicate with the server.   

## Features:
Our application will allow the user to :  
• fetch and view the latest “tweets”,  
• authenticate (register, log-on, and log-off),  
• post messages (authenticated users only), and  
• delete messages that the user posted (bonus feature).  

## Tech Topics:  
The project covers a variety of topics:  
• UI controllers and views,  
• keyboard input and user interaction,  
• data persistence including using the iOS Keychain for secure storage of user information, and  
• HTTP GET/POST communication with a RESTful API via Alamofire.
